**Recent Progress:**
- ErrorBoundary and NotificationSystem tests are now passing and provide good coverage for error handling and notification flows.
- Fixed double /api/api/ endpoint issues in AuthContext and api services.
- TypeScript and Jest errors for ErrorBoundary and NotificationSystem are resolved.

**Next Steps:**
- Add/expand tests for Auth flows, Members, Dashboard, and API services.
- Add integration and e2e tests for user flows.
- Improve a11y and edge case coverage.

### Core Components
- [‚úÖ] ErrorBoundary (unit tests, error UI, retry, go home, bug report)
- [‚úÖ] NotificationSystem (unit tests, notification display, dismiss, action button)
- [ ] Layout
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Members
- [ ] Auth (LoginPage, ForgotPasswordPage, ChangePasswordDialog)
- [ ] CheckInForm, CheckInList, CheckInButton
- [ ] EmailTemplateManager, EmailTemplatesPage
